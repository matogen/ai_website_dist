            <h2>Achieving agriculture 3.0</h2>
            <p>
              Farming has worked differently since the Third Agricultural
              Revolution. It is driven by data, and is often referred to as
              “digital farming”. Agriculture 3.0 is characterised by the
              large-scale use of data to drive food production to levels that
              far outperform the two previous agricultural revolutions:
              mechanisation and genetic modification, respectively. Data
              produced by customised farming software products, weather
              stations, satellite imagery, leaf and soil samples, as well as
              irrigation systems, are measured and analysed to optimise yield,
              efficiency and profitability.
            </p>
            <h3>Some of our work with agricultural operations</h3>
            <p>
              Matogen Applied Insights is a digital farming expert who works with agricultural
              businesses to solve problems in efficiency, environmental impact,
              production and profit. We leverage international best practices
              from the fields of statistics and machine learning in synergy with
              clients’ agricultural expertise to examine trends and impart
              data-driven insights. This empowers our clients to make better
              decisions towards more efficient farming practices, saving time
              and money, as well as limiting wastage and reducing risk.
              <br /><br />
              Undertakings within the farming industry include systems such as
              dashboards, bots and electronic alerts for weather risk and crop
              protection, spraying conditions, as well as plant disease image
              recognition. In addition, the analysis of agricultural data
              allowed for the identification of trends in growth phases,
              nutrient deficiencies and irrigation. However, it is within the
              realm of predictive analytics that Matogen Applied Insights’ unique approach and
              cooperative capabilities position it favourably to contribute
              towards the Third Agricultural Revolution. Completed forecasting
              projects range from the prediction of crop disease risk and plant
              nutrient deficiency, as well as optimal harvest date and
              irrigation practices.
            </p>

              If you would like to discuss digitising your farming operation or
              agricultural business, making it more efficient and more
              profitable, please
